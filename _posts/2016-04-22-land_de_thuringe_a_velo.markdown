            <h1>Bike path in the Ilm Valley</h1>
            <p>This bike path crosses Thüringen from north east to south west following the Ilm river. I took it from Bad Berka almost until this end, in the Thüringer Forest, but it actually starts in Weimar. All in all it does 123 kms, very easy to bike, nice landscapes. You will find more information <a href="http://www.ilmtal-radweg.de/radweg/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h1>Thüringer Wald</h1>
            <p>GPS and me, it is definitely over. It keeps sending me to dirt roads which I cannot ride. It does not understand that I want Asphalt, I want flat roads, I want cars, trucks, everything but no dirt roads! The region of the Thüringer Wald is very hilly, goes up to 850 meters. So it was a tough day, plus the GPS mistake that costed me an additonal 20 kilometers on the 100 planned. Fortunately, I could rely on my Ferrari. See next Video.</p>

           <p>As you can see, in the video, people from Thüringer have good flair for good bikes. They are also very generous. I was hosted in Jena by Konrad and Sophie in Ilmenau, who I met on WarmShowers. Thank you again! I had a great time there! Next step: Bavaria</p>
