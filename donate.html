            <p>Journeying is not a hobby for everyone</p>
            <p>Not all journeys are as nice as Berlin-Lisbon, not everyone can cross borders so easily. Journeys are not always wanted, they are not always a hobby.
            However, we have in Berlin every weeks lots of refugees coming from a long journey. 
            "Refugees or not Refugees" is no longer the question. We biggest issue we face now is : how to integrate them.</p>
            <p>I found an association working to help refugees become guides of museums. 
            I believe it's a nice way to build a link between our societies as it make refugees get to know our culture.
            To be able to carry out such a project, they need our help now.
            You can make a donation through betterplace.org or directy on their website.</p>
